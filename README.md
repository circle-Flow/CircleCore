# CircleCore
CircleCore is an open-source, community-driven initiative by CircleLabs to build the next generation of ultra-fast, modular, and AI-optimized processors. Our mission is to democratize chip innovation — enabling developers, researchers, and hardware enthusiasts worldwide to design, simulate, and test chips .


🪐 CircleLabs / CircleCore

> "The next Intel or NVIDIA won’t be a corporation — it’ll be a community."

CircleCore is an **open-source, high-performance chip architecture project** by **CircleLabs**.  
We aim to democratize chip innovation by creating a **RISC-V-based processor** optimized for AI, ML, and high-throughput workloads. Contributors worldwide can design, simulate, and test next-gen chips — all in the open.

## 🚀 Why CircleCore

The chip industry has long been dominated by a few corporations. CircleCore changes that by:

- 💻 Making **chip design open and accessible**  
- 🌍 Enabling **global collaboration** for hardware innovation  
- ⚡ Building **high-performance, modular, and AI-optimized cores**  

Our long-term vision is to **rival top-tier processors** like Intel Core i9 and NVIDIA H100 in specific workloads using open-source tools and community power.
